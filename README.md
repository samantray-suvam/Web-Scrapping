I have created a small web scrapping project.
it's in its beginning phase, Plans are to automate it further, to ease the user while extracting data.
Currently it has the Amazon's Book page embedded, one can easily change the url and find it really simple to operate once familiar with the tools.

I have used BeautifulSoup4 to scrape the web, really useful.

I might work with Selenium next.
